              <h3>Tasks Undertaken</h3>

              <p>Our initial idea wasn't actually to do a video about the IRA Manchester Bomb. Instead we had originally planned to do a video on the development of architectural structures in Manchester over the last 50 years. However, this never made it passed the pitching stage as the feedback we received was that this idea was too broad and that we should focus on the development over the last 20 years, after the IRA Manchester bomb. We then decided as a group that we felt it would be more interesting to talk about the Manchester IRA bomb and the aftermath of the event.</p>

              <p>While we were filimng, there were many considerations we had to take as we faced a few set backs. Our main set back was that we couldn't find any participants to interview about the event that took place that day. we wanted to find some people who had at least been in the city on the day or if they knew a friend/family member who was in the city. Without interviews, we had lost some vital footage time and would have to fill the time gap in some other method. However, we did not let this hinder us in any way, <cite>“don’t let the whole day’s shoot go to crap because of a single set back"</cite> (Artis, 2014:108), so to solve this issue we choose to look back at some brief hisroy of the IRA and the build up to the Manchester bomb.</p>

              <p>Audio was another problem we faced. We found it very difficult when it came to recording the narrative as there wasa lot of background noise on most of the recordings. Having background noise in our video was not an option. <cite>“Sound carries the emotion of your video, it’s half of the picture. Paying attention to sound, both in terms of good recording and how it’s mixed and the use of sound effects and music, can make a real difference."</cite> (Tames, 2013:Online). Nearly every location we went too was quiet, but there was no escpaing the background noise. To solve this we had to remove the moise using some audio editing software. After watching the video I feel we suceeded in removing the background noise, but I fell the audio as a result became a tad echoey which isnt the end of the world in my opinion.</p>

              <p>While shooting we had set goals that we wanted to achieve while filming, but as we began filming we felt that sticking to these goals and sticking to the exact storyboard we had created, just wouldn't work as we realised it would not allow us to be more flexible during filming should anything go wrong and something always does go wrong. We decided to follow the idea of <cite>“shoot your story with an open mind"</cite> (Bernard:2004). Since we didn’t have much time to do any re-shooting we got what we could. Sticking to the exact storyboard would have hindered us greatly, so we felt the best option was to be more flexible around our goals abd storyboard.</p>

              <p>Overall, we felt as a group that the project had many great aspects that we could focus on. However, we felt that if we could have gotten at least one interview, we could have told a better story about the day of the Manchester bomb and that this would engage more with the audience. This is the biggest improvement that we would do to this video.</p>

              <h3>Stylistic Vision For The Film</h3>

              <p>Pre-production was a very pivotal part of the documentary process, as it was the first task that would set the stylistic vision for the documentary. As a group we wanted to create an idea that was informative, enjoyable and located in the heart of Manchester to create a more personal touch.</p>

              <p>During our brainstorming process, each member of the group wrote down all their ideas for the film and then we collectively came to a decision on which idea we would choose. As stated previously, we initially went along the idea of filming architectural structures in Manchester over the last 50 years.</p>

              <p>After the feedback from the pitching process, we decided to film about the IRA Manchester bomb. We didn't have any problems with location, as the event took place in Manchester City Centre, but we did have problems with how we would acquire footage of the actual van exploding. Luckily, we were able to get in contact with Greater Manchester Police, who had actual footage from a police helicopter of the van exploding, so we asked them if we could use the footage and it is vital that permission <cite>“must be cleared by the relevant authority unless you care to run risk being taken to court"</cite> (2009:376). They allowed us to use the footage as long as we mentioned them in the credits. Acquiring this footage was vital to the documentary as not having this footage would have severely hindered the project.</p>

              <p>After choosing to move forward with the idea of the Manchester IRA bomb, we began looking at which interviewees would be the most promising for the documentary narrative. While going through what interviewees we should look for, we found it was decided to make a check list that would bring context to the documentary. One of the final stages of the preproduction of the documentary was narrowing down the strong candidates. As Artis suggests <cite>“the people you ultimately choose to speak on your topic are equally crucial to the success of your doc"</cite> (2014:11). In the end we couldn't find any relevant particiants to interview about the event.</p>

              <p>When we realised we couldn't find participants to interview about the event, we decided to look back at a bref history of the IRA and then build it up to the Manchester bomb. This way we felt this would take the audience onto a journey they could follow and we feel it’s important to have a compelling narrative as Bernard suggests that it is critical to <cite>“reach people with a subject and story that grabs them"</cite> (2004:33).</p>
