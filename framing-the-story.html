              <h3>Introduction</h3>

              <p>The title of editor appealed to me as I has prior experience using software such as premiere pro and Adobe After effects, this was due to the fact I was editor on the last project which again involved creating a documentary. I initially had the intention of being the camera man as I also had experience in that field however editor was more appealing. The role of editor is to bring every idea, concept, video and pieces of audio together to try and enhance the viewer's interpretation and therefore convey the story intended by the director. The editor conveys the director's ideas by implementing effects such as transitioning and cuts to invoke a response from the audience. The role of editor could be considered the most important as it requires communication between the other four parties and any misinterpretation can make or break the documentary as a whole. More importantly based on the nature of the documentary it is of paramount importance that the editing is done correctly as we do not want to offend or seem biased based on the sequence the footage is shown in.</p>

              <h3>Representation</h3>

              <p>To enhance the effect of our documentary, we took the opportunity to implement a non-linear narrative opposed to a linear narrative. This would allow the audience to understand the events that took place in the past for the conflict to have arisen.  A non-linear narrative is when the main narrative is disjointed and often used where events are portrayed, in our case this would come in the form of pieces that are not in chronological order. <cite>"a non-linear narrative often starts at the middle of a story or the height of a conflict and then double-backs to the beginning."</cite> (Wroblewski: no date: online) This allows us to build up-to the events of the IRA bomb but double back between footage of modern day Manchester and Manchester during the bomb. On the other hand the use of a linear narrative would have allowed for us to provide the background information regarding the IRA then follow up with the bomb. This however I believed was not the best way for the documentary to be edited, non-linear allows a shift between the changes that happened during 1996 and those still stand today. A linear narrative would not have allowed us to provide a story that coincides with the time of the bomb and current day architecture, instead it would have forced us to provide the modern day changes first and then double back into the history of the bomb which for our target range of audience was unmethodical.</p>

              <p>To further enforce the history throughout the documentary we implemented a narrator to follow along with the main narrative. Doing this allows the users to both see visually the impact that the bomb had on the city of Manchester but to hear the historical importance and changes that had been made to the city. In addition to this we didn't feel it was necessary to provide personal opinions on the matter with the use of interviews or the personal opinion of the narrator as the subject we covered is one that carries much controversy therefore it was in our best interest to only implement facts and historical data.</p>

              <h3>Technical Aspects Of Editing Used</h3>

              <p>Throughout the documentary I developed the cuts and transitions in a way that would flash between the past and the present of the same locations, I achieved this by using jump cuts when there is video footage involved and adding fades if pictures were present. Throughout it can be seen that there are a significant amount of fades, these are used to try and convey the damage that has been caused and then contrast them with present day footage, additionally the fade was used to transition between the final changes and the end of the documentary into the credit sequence. The two types of fades used were either fade to black or fade to white. The white fades were implemented when the footage was not directly involved with IRA bomb but had a historical importance.  G. Moura (no date given) says fade cuts <cite>"are used sparingly because they imply the end of a major story segment"</cite>.  Another type of transition that was used throughout was the jump cut this is best explained as <cite>"The opposite of a match cut, the jump cut is an abrupt cut between 2 shots that calls attention to itself because it does not match the shots seamlessly. It marks a transition in time and space but is called a jump cut because it jars the sensibilities"</cite>. S. Hayward (1996) this is believed to be the second most used transition which you see on screen, often included in many popular films as it allows the story to be abruptly moved onto a different scene without making the viewer question everything in-between.</p>

              <p>Another technical aspect of editing that was used was the walk through, this is when the audio starts yet there is no visuals that coexist with the audio, in our case this was the scene with the bomb. We had the ambience of Manchester playing up until the explosion to evoke the sense of helplessness that the people In Manchester at the time must have had. We could choose to have screams however we felt this wouldnâ€™t be as powerful as cutting from ambient chatter to an explosion. Doing this effect also allows the viewer to transition into the narrative a little better.</p>

              <p>In conclusion the editor was one of if not the most major part in the process of developing the documentary and is in charge of how the final productions feelings are conveyed. To achieve the correct mood and feel for the audience it is quintessential that the transitions and cuts are used in such a way that the story is told correctly and with the correct non-linear narrative. Overall I believe this was achieved in the final piece and all footage both filmed and archive was combined to provide an in-depth documentary catered towards those with an interest in the history of Manchester.</p>
