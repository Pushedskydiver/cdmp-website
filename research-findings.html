              <h2>Patrick's Research</h2>

              <p>In this piece, I am going to be guiding you on how myself, the researcher, found the information needed in order for us to produce a short documentary as a group.</p>

              <p>The reason we chosen this topic is because we believe it is a unique approach and a topic that has not been focused on before. Furthermore, with the majority of the group members being from Manchester, we believed this key feature would enable us to get information about the event from family members and not straight from the internet itself. This means we could emphasise certain parts of the event in which we couldn’t if we had taken all of the information from the internet.</p>

              <h3>Findings On The Subject</h3>

              <p>As we decided to create a documentary on such a specific topic, I researched and looked into documentaries that had been created previously on topics similar to ours. Due to the nature of them, I noticed that the majority of the documentaries were told within a chronological order and as a group this is how we decided to do it as well.</p>

              <p>With a few simple search engine queries, I was able to find a large amount of news documents regarding the bombing. These news articles gave us a huge insight into the bombing and also included key statistics regarding the event which we could then emphasise within the documentary.</p>

              <p>Not only was I able to find news articles regarding the bombing, I was also able to find a photo album located on Flickr which contained a lot of useful photos that were taken when the incident happened. We contacted Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service who granted us permission to use these photos within our documentary. This was a huge breakthrough for us because these enabled us to start thinking about the voice over for the documentary.</p>

              <p>Finding an interviewee was probably the hardest element of the creation of the documentary. The topic we had chosen made this harder as we couldn't just ask any person in the street a question regarding the bombing as we didn’t know if they were there when it happened. We had to specifically find a person who we knew could provide us with a detailed and reasonable answer.</p>

              <p>The whole research process allowed me to really get an in depth idea of what happened on that day. This allowed me to share my findings with my group members where we also had in depth discussions to help understand the way in which we were going to create and direct the documentary. The research allowed us as a group to jot down ideas such as a storyboard (visible on "Filming the project").</p>

              <p>I managed to ask one of my grandparents about the blast and what they remembered about it however due to certain health restrictions a full interview couldn't take place which was unfortunate as I believe a lot of information could have been gained from my grandparent.</p>

              <h3>History And Context</h3>

              <p>Quite a lot of the information we found was located on the Manchester Evening News website. The reason being that the news on there is aimed directly at areas in and around Manchester. Not only did the website contain information regarding the day the event happened, there was also other articles related to the bomb such as interviews and also video footage. The MEN website not only gave us information about the event but also other articles such as how Manchester has changed as a city since the blast and the regeneration of the city since the unfortunate event.</p>

              <p>Whilst researching, I learnt that there were no fatalities during the blast however <cite>200+ people were injured during it.</cite> (Williams, 2015). This was a key fact that I found and felt it was something that needed emphasizing highly within the documentary. We also learnt how the bomb was planted and was provided with photographs and video of the explosion taking place.</p>

              <p>Another key part of the event was that a young child was injured during the blast. A photograph was taken of this and was published in multiple newspapers and articles. To this day it is a photograph which is remembered very clearly. The MEN newspaper managed to have an interview with the mother and also with her child.</p>

              <p>Lisa said: <cite>"It was a life-changing experience. I eventually gave up my career at BT and focused on Sam. Nothing else seemed important. I completely lost my confidence. I was quite a strong character but it burst my bubble. I couldn't go back into Manchester for a long time. For six or seven years, I wouldn’t go into the city centre. It brought back too many memories."</cite> (Thompson, 2011:Online).</p>

              <p>The above was taken from the MEN website and was an interview with the mother. She expresses how badly the blast impacted her life and her ,at the time, newborn sons life. In my opinion this article helped convince us as to how bad the impact was and how it affected a number of lives regardless that there were no fatal casualties.</p>

              <h2>Tom's Research</h2>

              <p>Writing the voiceover meant gathering the facts and reproducing them in the form of an interesting and engaging narrative. Hammond and Wellington (2012: 9) describe this as analysis. Analysis generally refers to the breaking down of a topic or object into its component parts and understanding how those parts fit together.</p>

              <h3>Findings On The Subject</h3>

              <p>With the documentary set to unfold in a chronological fashion it was necessary to research not just the events of the day of the bomb itself, but the political landscape beforehand and the regeneration of the city that occurred in its aftermath. I was nine years old at the time of the 1996 Manchester bombing, old enough to recall snippets of television news footage from the time but no more than that. The research was of additional interest to me on a personal level, in that sense, as it shone a light on what were previously only hazy childhood memories. Walliman (2010: 1) defines research as "a term used liberally for any kind of investigation that is intended to uncover interesting or new facts" and I think my limited knowledge helped satisfy that definition. It became apparent that the IRA and its history, at least in the context of the bombing of Manchester, was the first subject area I needed to read up on. Secondly I needed to find out what actually happened on the day of the bomb, how much destruction it caused, where it was planted, how was it discovered and how the people were evacuated. Finally, I needed to research the regeneration effort that came afterwards – how the designs for a rebuilt city centre were submitted and decided upon, who decided, what they were and how successful they were.  These three different elements obviously require different levels of research and the potential use of different forms of media as my resources. The history of the IRA was more widely available than some of the details required for the other two areas. The method in which historical information is researched can affect the outcome of that research. Gunn and Faire (2011: 4) refer to how "Methods matter because the way we study a phenomenon shapes (or may even determine) the knowledge we derive of it."</p>

              <p>The IRA claimed responsibility for the bomb yet no one has ever been convicted nor are they likely to be so. It has been suggested that this was due to the desire to keep the peace process in good stead, and that, in 2016, it no longer represents a pressing issue. The IRA were an offshoot from the old Irish Republican Army whose objective was to take Northern Ireland back from the United Kingdom and reunify Ireland. Broadly speaking, they began an offensive campaign on UK targets, using bombs and guerrilla warfare in an attempt to force the UK government into relinquishment. The watershed moment for the IRA, certainly in terms of recruiting members to its cause, was the Bloody Sunday incident of 1972.British soldiers shot 26 unarmed protesters in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland. 14 of them were killed.</p>

              <p>(Cowell-Meyers, 2015). David Cameron formally apologised for the tragedy in 2010. Various ceasefires and truces are scattered throughout the timeline of the IRA’s offensive but by the 1990s the IRA and dissident organisations had claimed responsibility for at least 10,000 bomb attacks across the UK, Northern Ireland and Ireland. (Melaugh, 1996) The Manchester bombing occurred during a ceasefire and was theorised to suggest that the IRA were sending a message that they can essentially strike at any time.  A truck containing the bomb was planted on the corner of Corporation Street on the morning of Saturday the 15th of June.</p>

              <p>A man with an Irish accent rang Granada Studios at Quay Street and using an IRA code word to confirm his legitimacy, warned of a bomb. The warning was taken as legitimate and the police were called immediately. There were an estimated 75 to 80 thousand people working and shopping in the area at the time. The police ordered for a mass evacuation as soon as possible. A bomb disposal squad was drafted in but failed to defuse the bomb with a remote-controlled device. At 11:17am the bomb detonated. (1996 Manchester bombing, 2016).</p>

              <p>No one was killed by the blast, a fact attributed to luck rather than considered planning by the IRA. 600 businesses were wrecked. Public and private task forces were set up and the town hall was used as a makeshift place of refuge for those whose livelihoods had been offset by the bomb. Richard Leese, the Leader of Manchester City Council said at the time:</p>

              <p>People say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That’s rubbish. We suffered a grievous blow and it was probably one of our darkest hours. I don’t know what it was like in the Blitz but it could not have been much bloody worse. (The Manchester Bomb: From Devastation to Regeneration, 2006: 80)</p>

              <p>Michael Heseltine, the then Deputy Prime Minister commissioned an international design competition to procure a blueprint for the city’s redevelopment. Designs came in from around the world and global design company EDAW and Manchester based Ian Simpson were the victors. The bomb came at a time when Manchester’s reputation as the UK’s second city was under threat due to possible competition from out of town shopping centres like the Trafford centre, which was nearing completion. Property experts feared the centre could go the way of Sheffield with its economic strength and vitality diminished. For the sake of Manchester’s future as the UK’s second city it became vital to keep to the project deadlines imposed. The Arndale Centre, previously disliked for its drab 70s aesthetic, had its northern half flattened and rebuilt to re-open in 2003. Sinclair’s Oyster Bar and The Old Wellington Inn were moved, brick by brick, 300 metres closer to the cathedral in order to make way for Marks and Spencer’s new home, Exchange Square. New Cathedral Street, a pedestrian route to link St Ann’s Square and the cathedral was created alongside the cathedral gardens. The Printworks welcomed its first customers in 2000. The Urbis building, now home to the National Football Museum, opened in 2002 as a symbol of Manchester’s regeneration. (The Manchester Bomb: From Devastation to Regeneration, 2006)</p>
